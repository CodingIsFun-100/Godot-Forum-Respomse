PS, im a new user and can only put 1 image in a post, so i put the full respone on github, link

I love how the menu is creative and sets itself apart from other games.
1. The hard cut between the title and menu threw me off. Maybe just a simple zoom transition or just a zig-zag thing would be better.

I think this is a great way to make the menu feel like part of the game, but it blends in with the background too well. Maybe a shadow, or a bigger outline, but I say keep the cool text effect,

3. If your clicking on the buttons to send you to different menus or parts of the game, you will only see the cool button art for only a split second, so i think a better idea would be to have the hover effect be the art instead of the clicking, i think that this wouldnt be distracting becauase it only shows when your hovering.

4. One thing to think about is the perspective in this shot.

The bear (i think it's a bear, like maybe a teddy bear???) is facing to the right, in the next shot,

The bear is facing forward

The thing about this is that for the first angle, the camera would be here (the black cube) and pointing forward (the orange arrow). This might feel weird or off to you or some people, and I think the best thing to do might be to make a mockup of how it would look at a different angle.

This is a very small thing to think about, but it might feel better to you if the camera were in front of the bear, looking at the feet, maybe like here?

5. In the first (close-up) shot, there isn't a lot of detail on the bear; adding some detail would make it look more like legs.
One major thing to think about when doing detail on the legs is the direction of the light. Based on the shadows, the light looks like it's coming from here.

7. The scale seems Off. In the first shot, the legs seem HUGE compared to the thin flat ground (being thin and flat makes it seem like the ground plane that your looking at is big, making the legs seem even bigger, A way of putting it is like this, in the first shot, it seems like if you dropped a person in there the person would only be as tall the the bears toe, but in the second that it would be almost as tall as the bear.) 

Those are my thoughts, if i think of anything else ill add it,
